This project was architecturally inspired by PDFMathTranslate (pdf2zh).

  PDFMathTranslate is a PDF document translation tool that preserves
  formatting, formulas, and layout. epub2kr adapts the same pipeline
  architecture (parse -> extract -> translate -> reconstruct) for EPUB files.

  NOTE: epub2kr is a clean-room implementation. No source code was copied
  from PDFMathTranslate. Only the high-level architectural design pattern
  (pipeline-based document translation with layout preservation, pluggable
  translation service backends, and caching) was used as reference.

  While AGPL-3.0 copyleft does not legally apply to independent
  implementations inspired by architectural patterns (copyright protects
  expression, not ideas), this project voluntarily adopts AGPL-3.0 out of
  respect for the original project and the open-source community.
